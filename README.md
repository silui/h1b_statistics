# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years. 

This progrma allows you to quickly find the Top element of your desired column. Currently works on work location state and occupation. 

# Approach

First by opening .csv file into python as csv, it creates 2D list. Then start by getting iterating through all row with the targeted column and add to a frequency counter by 1 if that row is __CERTIFIED__. The built-in Counter() include most_common() property that return some number of most common elemnt. Then sort that list alphabetically in a tie. Finally, calculate the percentage of a particular state or occupation.

To future proof the program, I have __DICT__ at the beginning of main.py. In a case where USDOL decided to change file structure or column header name, user can add more to it.
